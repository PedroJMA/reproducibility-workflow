# Reproducbility workflow

Every project should consist of a single well structured directory with meaningful subdirectories. Data cleaning and analyses should be carefully documented in a Jupyter Notebook or R markdown file and should be created with reproducibility in mind. Everyone on the team (and future you) should be able to re-create what you have performed.

The overall purpose is to have an organized project structure in place so that the project is easily approachable to many different individuals.


## The data

All data should be backed up on something like Google Drive or Box.
